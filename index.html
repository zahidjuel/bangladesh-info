                <p>
                    Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush
                    greenery and many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and
                    travel by boat is common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest shared
                    with Eastern India, is home to the royal Bengal tiger. ― Google

                    <p>
                        Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s
                        at the center of national government, trade and culture. The 17th-century old city was the
                        Mughal capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain. American architect Louis Khan’s
                        National Parliament House complex typifies the huge, fast-growing modern metropolis. ― Google
